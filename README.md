Q: Do you plan on releasing other Bootstrap websites?

A: There is a possibility I will be releasing other web development projects using Bootstrap.

Q: Am I new to Bootstrap?

A: Yes, I am. This is my first project I made using Bootstrap. All my other websites are fully made from scratch. I find Bootstrap very easy to use. Although Bootstrap is simple, it is very powerful.
